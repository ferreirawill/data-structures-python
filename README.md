# Data Structures with python

This project was built for my own studies about data structures following this [book](http://opendatastructures.org/ods-python.pdf).
The main objective here was understood better the time complexity among the addressed structures to evaluate the pros and cons of each of them focusing on readability, code complexity and time complexity.

## Project Structure

In `src/` each chapter of the book has a package with the data structures addressed. Inside each package there is a module 
with the name of the structure and inside it has its implementation. 

Still in `src/` there is other important things:
* ***`Interfaces/` package:*** Here is the interfaces that some structures should implement to be a valid data structure.
* ***`tests/` package:***  Has some the tests for each structure implemented to help the development and to see the structure working.
* ***DataHandler.py:*** Just a module to help to store the structures and the methods to access them.
* ***main.py:*** The main file to run the project and generate the comparison graphs.
